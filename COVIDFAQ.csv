What is corona virus?,Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
What is COVID-19?,COVID-19  is  the  infectious  disease  caused  by  the  most  recently  discovered  corona  virus. This  new  virus  and  disease  were  unknown  before the outbreak began in Wuhan China in December 2019.
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever tiredness and dry  cough.  Some  patients  may  have  aches  and  pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don?t  develop  any  symptoms  and  don't  feel  unwell.  Most  people (about  80%)  recover  from  the  disease  without  needing  special treatment.  Around  1  out  of  every  6  people  who  gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
How does COVID-19 spread?,People  can  catch  COVID-19  from  others  who  have  the virus.  The  disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from  the nose or mouth which are spread when a person  with COVID-19 coughs  or  exhales.  These  droplets  land  on  objects  and  surfaces  around  the  person.  Other  people  then  catch  COVID-19  by  touching  these  objects  or  surfaces  then  touching  their  eyes  nose  or  mouth.  People  can  also  catch  COVID-19  if  they  breathe  in  droplets  from  a  person  with  COVID-19  who  coughs  out  or  exhales  droplets.  This  is  why  it  is  important  to  stay  more  than  1  meter  (3  feet)  away  from  a  person who is sick.
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted  through  contact  with  respiratory  droplets  rather  than through  the  air.   See  previous  answer  on  ?How  does COVID-19 spread??
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,The  main  way  the  disease  spreads  is  through  respiratory  droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone  with  no  symptoms  at  all  is  very  low.  However  many people  with  COVID-19  experience  only  mild  symptoms.  This  is particularly  true  at  the  early  stages  of  the  disease.  It  is  therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill.
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases spread through this route is not a main  feature  of  the  outbreak.  The  ongoing  research on  the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk however it is another reason to clean hands regularly after using the bathroom and before eating.
What  can  I  do  to  protect  myself  and  prevent  the  spread  of   disease?,"Protection measures for everyone 
Stay  aware  of  the  latest  information  on  the  COVID-19  outbreak available on the nationalstate and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. 
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: 
? Regularly  and  thoroughly  clean  your  hands  with  an  alcohol-based  hand  rub  or  wash  them  with  soap  and  water. Why?  Washing  your  hands  with  soap  and  water  or  using    alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 
   ? Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and      anyone      who     is     coughing     or    sneezing.  Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid      droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you  are  too  close  you  can  breathe  in  the  droplets  including  the      COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 
   ? Avoid     touching    eyes    nose      and     mouth.    Why?  Hands  touch  many  surfaces  and  can  pick  up  viruses. Once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes   nose or mouth. From there  the  virus can enter your  body and can make you sick. 
   ? Make  sure  you  and  the  people  around  you  follow  good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then  dispose     of    the    used     tissue    immediately. Why?  Droplets  spread  virus.  By  following  good  respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as   cold flu and COVID-19. 
  ? Stay  home  if  you  feel  unwell.  If  you  have  a  fever cough  and   difficulty breathing seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow  the  directions  of  your  local  health  authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date  information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 
? Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local    areas  where  COVID-19  is  spreading  widely).  If  possible  avoid  traveling  to  places  ?  especially  if  you  are  an  older  person  or have     diabetes    heart     or     lung    disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."
Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading?,"Follow  the  guidance  outlined  above  (Protection  measures  for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell even with mild symptoms such as headache low grade fever (37.3 C or  above)  and  slight  runny  nose  until  you  recover.  If  it  is essential for you to have someone bring  you supplies or to go out e.g. to buy food then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will  allow  these  facilities  to  operate  more  effectively  and  help protect  you  and  others  from  possible  COVID-19  and  other viruses.
If  you  develop  fever  cough  and  difficulty  breathing  seek medical  advice  promptly  as  this  may  be  due  to  a  respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider  of  any  recent  travel  or  contact  with  travelers. Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For  most  people  in  most  locations  the  risk  of  catching  COVID-19  is still  low.  However  there  are  now  places  around  the  world  (cities  or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in or visitingthese  areas  the  risk  of  catching  COVID-19  is  higher.  Governments and  health  authorities  are  taking  vigorous  action  every  time  a  new case  of  COVID-19  is  identified.  Be  sure  to  comply  with  any  local restrictions on travel movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease  control  efforts  will  reduce  your  risk  of  catching  or  spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped as has  been  shown  in  China  and  some  other  countries.  Unfortunately new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It?s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.
Should I worry about COVID-19?,Illness  due  to  COVID-19  infection  is  generally  mild  especially  for children  and  young  adults.  However  it  can  cause  serious  illness:about  1  in  every  5  people  who  catch  it  need  hospital  care.  It  is therefore  quite  normal  for  people  to worry  about  how  the  COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We  can  channel  our  concerns  into  actions  to  protect  ourselves  our loved  ones  and  our  communities.  First  and  foremost among  these actions  is  regular  and  thorough  hand-washing  and  good  respiratory hygiene.  Secondly  keep  informed  and  follow  the  advice  of the  local health  authorities  including  any  restrictions  put  in  place  on  travelmovement and gatherings.
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,While  we  are  still  learning  about  how  COVID-2019  affects  peopleolder persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as  high  blood  pressure  heart  disease  lung  disease  cancer  or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others.
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,No.  Antibiotics  do  not  work  against  viruses  they  only  work  on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment  of  COVID-19.  They  should  only  be  used  as directed  by  a physician to treat a bacterial infection.
Are  there  any  medicines  or  therapies  that  can  prevent  or  cure COVID-19?,While  some  western  traditional  or  home  remedies  may  provide comfort  and  alleviate  symptoms  of  COVID-19  there  is  no  evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not recommend self-medication with any medicines including antibioticsas  a  prevention  or  cure  for  COVID-19.  However  there  are  several ongoing  clinical  trials  that  include  both  western  and  traditional medicines. We  will  continue  to  provide  updated  information  as  soon as clinical findings are available
Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19?,Not yet. To date there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to  prevent  or  treat  COVID-2019.  However  those  affected  should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible  vaccines  and  some  specific  drug  treatments  are  under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. The  most  effective  ways  to  protect  yourself  and  others  against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands cover your cough with the  bend  of  elbow  or  tissue  and  maintain  a  distance  of  at  least  1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,No.  The  virus  that  causes  COVID-19  and  the  one  that  caused  the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related  to  each  other  genetically  but  the  diseases  they  cause  are quite different. SARS  was  more  deadly  but  much  less  infectious  than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.
Should I wear mask to protect myself?,Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing)  or  looking  after  someone  who  may  have  COVID-19.Disposable  face  mask  can  only  be  used  once.  If  you are  not  ill  or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a  world-wide  shortage  of  masks  so  We  urge  people  to  use  masks wisely.We  advises  rational  use  of  medical  masks  to  avoid  unnecessary wastage  of  precious  resources  and  mis-use  of  masks   The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands cover your cough with the bend of elbow or  tissue  and  maintain  a  distance  of  at  least  1  meter  (3  feet)  from people who are coughing or sneezing.
How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask?,"1. Remember a mask should only be used by health workers care takersand individuals with respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough.
2. Before  touching  the  mask  clean  hands  with  an  alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
5. Ensure  the  proper  side  of  the  mask  faces  outwards  (the coloured side).
6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
7. Pull down the mask?s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
8. After  use  take  off  the  mask;  remove  the  elastic  loops  from behind  the  ears  while  keeping  the  mask  away  from  your  face and clothes to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
10.    Perform  hand  hygiene  after  touching  or  discarding  the mask  ?  Use  alcohol-based  hand  rub  or  if  visibly  soiled  wash your hands with soap and water."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The  incubation  period  means  the  time  between  catching  the  virus and  beginning  to  have  symptoms  of  the  disease.  Most  estimates  of the  incubation  period  for  COVID-19  range  from  1-14 days  most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.
To protect yourself such as when visiting live animal markets avoid direct  contact  with  animals  and  surfaces  in  contact  with  animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"While  there  has  been one  instance  of  a  dog  being  infected  in  Hong Kong  to date  there  is  no  evidence  that  a  dog  cat  or  any  pet  can transmit  COVID-19.  COVID-19  is  mainly  spread  through  droplets produced  when  an  infected  person  coughs  sneezes  or  speaks.  To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces  but  it  seems  to  behave  like  other  corona viruses.  Studies suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19  virus)  may  persist  on  surfaces  for  a  few  hours  or  up  to several  days.  This  may  vary  under  different  conditions  (e.g.  type  of surface temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes mouth or nose. Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19  has been reported?Yes.  The  likelihood  of  an  infected  person  contaminating  commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from  a  package  that  has  been  moved  travelled  and exposed  to different conditions and temperature is also low.
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT  effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:
? Smoking
? Wearing multiple masks
? Taking antibiotics (See question 10 "" Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19? "")
In  any  case  if  you  have  fever  cough  and  difficulty  breathing seek  medical  care  early  to  reduce  the  risk  of  developing  a  more severe infection and be sure to share  your recent travel history  with your health care provider."

How dangerous is corona virus,"Virus is not dangerous, but we have to be very cautious."
How to know whether we are having corona virus,The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever tiredness and dry  cough.  Some  patients  may  have  aches  and  pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don?t  develop  any  symptoms  and  don't  feel  unwell.  Most  people (about  80%)  recover  from  the  disease  without  needing  special treatment.  Around  1  out  of  every  6  people  who  gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

Incubation period of corona virus,"The  incubation  period  means  the  time  between  catching  the  virus and  beginning  to  have  symptoms  of  the  disease.  Most  estimates  of the  incubation  period  for  COVID-19  range  from  1-14 days  most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.
To protect yourself such as when visiting live animal markets avoid direct  contact  with  animals  and  surfaces  in  contact  with  animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."

spreading of covid-19,People  can  catch  COVID-19  from  others  who  have  the virus.  The  disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from  the nose or mouth which are spread when a person  with COVID-19 coughs  or  exhales.  These  droplets  land  on  objects  and  surfaces  around  the  person.  Other  people  then  catch  COVID-19  by  touching  these  objects  or  surfaces  then  touching  their  eyes  nose  or  mouth.  People  can  also  catch  COVID-19  if  they  breathe  in  droplets  from  a  person  with  COVID-19  who  coughs  out  or  exhales  droplets.  This  is  why  it  is  important  to  stay  more  than  1  meter  (3  feet)  away  from  a  person who is sick.

How long does the coronavirus last on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days."
Is coughing a symptom of the coronavirus disease?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually."

Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover."
Can the coronavirus disease spread through air?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."
How severe is the coronavirus disease?,"Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness."
